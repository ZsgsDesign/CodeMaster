## Installation

CentOS will be recommended for hosting NOJ, but all major operating systems are theoretically supported.

Till now, NOJ have been successfully deployed to the following systems:

- Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
- CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)
- Windows 10 Professional 10.0.17134 Build 17134

Here is detailed step about deploying NOJ:

1. You need to have a server and installed [PHP](http://php.net/downloads.php) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org);

2. Clone NOJ to your website folder;

```
cd /path-to-noj/
git clone https://github.com/ZsgsDesign/CodeMaster ./
```

3. Change your website root to `public` folder and then, if there is a `open_basedir` restriction, remove it;

4. Now run the following commands at the root folder of NOJ;

```
composer install
```

5. Almost done, you still got to modify a few folders and give them permission to write;

```
chmod -R 775 storage/
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/
chmod -R 775 app/Http/Controllers/VirtualCrawler/
chmod -R 775 app/Http/Controllers/VirtualJudge/
```

6. OK, right now we still need to configure environment, a typical `.env` just like the `.env.example`, you simply need to type the following codes;

```
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

7. Now, we need to configure the database, thankfully Laravel have migration already;

8. Lastly, we need to configure the virtual judger and online judger;

```
crontab -e
* * * * * php /path-to-noj/artisan schedule:run
```

9. NOJ's up-and-running, enjoy!
